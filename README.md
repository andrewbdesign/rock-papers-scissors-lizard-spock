RPSLS is an extension to the original game of rock-paper-scissors. The additional characters were added by [Sam Kass and Karen Bryla](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html) before being adopted, reordered, and [overpopularised by The Big Bang Theory](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock).

# Rules
![](images/RPSLS.png)

The rules are simple: Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.

My focus was to build something for desktop. Haven't done any responsive designs to it. Feel free to Submit PRs. 
Note: I've used emojis for this build, so it may look different on your operating system.
